# Web and Messaging

The browser is how we access the web, and a *lot* of useful information about us is stored in its data. Messaging apps are how we are using the internet to connect to our friends, families and increasingly how we take care of business - paying bills, shopping and more. How can we bridge these worlds? How can we make them complementary? Lets explore ways of making these two integral parts of our online lives play together!

Participation in this project can mean things like:

* Design: [Ideation](https://toolkit.mozilla.org/methods/) on possible types of integrations in either direction. Bots? Add-ons? Deep-linking? Games? Media? How can usage in one complement the other, in either direction?
* Research: Most popular messaging apps broken down by country and userbase, or listing the API abilities and links to documentation for the top apps?
* Research: What browser add-ons exist which integrate with messaging apps?
* Research on browser features and data which might be useful for sending to, or receiving from messaging apps. What add-on APIs existing in browsers for these, if any?
* Creating asset repositories or documenting the license and location of things like icons for the apps and the browsers.
* [Prototype](https://toolkit.mozilla.org/methods/) ideas for messaging app and browser integrations. Some discoveries are only possible by trying things out!
* Building or documenting tools for connecting services. For example, libraries for authenticating users to their messaging services or browser services.
* Anything else related to how the web and messaging apps can integrate. Your ideas have value!

Examples:

* A browser add-on for sending links, images or videos to your messaging apps.
* In-browser chatting and co-browsing with friends on different messaging networks.
* Adding deep linking support to mobile browsers using the various messaging app APIs.
* A bot for accessing your browser data - history, bookmarks, or top visited sites, etc. Maybe it can send those things to your friends or other devices. Maybe it can log you into websites and get information for you.
* What else?!
