# Web and Messaging

Browsers are how we access the web, and contain a *lot* of useful information about us - what we read, our schedule, our interests, where we shop, bank and more.

Messaging apps are how we connect to our friends, families, and increasingly how we talk to bots, services, devices and take care of business.

How can we bridge these worlds? How can we make them complementary?

Let's explore how to make these two integral parts of our online lives play together!

This project is part of the [Mozilla Global Sprint](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/) on May 10-11, 2018.
It's a gathering both in-person at sites around the world and online to collaborate on projects and learn from each other.
[Sign up here](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/participate/), and then read on to participate in this project.

Participation in this sprint can be anything that you'd like to do that is related to the topic:

* *Design:* [Ideation](https://toolkit.mozilla.org/method/idea-generation/) on possible types of integrations in either direction. Bots? Add-ons? Deep-linking? Games? Media? How can usage in one complement the other, in either direction? Add your ideas to the [Ideation issue](https://github.com/autonome/web-and-messaging/issues/1).
* *Research:* Most popular messaging apps broken down by country and userbase, or listing the API abilities and links to documentation for the top apps?
* *Research:* What browser add-ons exist which integrate with messaging apps?
* *Research:* Which browser features and data which might be useful for sending to, or receiving from messaging apps. What add-on APIs existing in browsers for these, if any?
* *Assets:* Creating asset repositories or documenting the license and URLs of things like icons for the apps and the browsers.
* *Prototypes:* [Prototype](https://toolkit.mozilla.org/methods/) ideas for messaging app and browser integrations. Some discoveries are only possible by trying things out!
* *Tools:* Building or documenting tools for connecting services. For example, libraries for authenticating users to their messaging services or browser services.
* *Anything* else you can think of related to how the web and messaging apps can integrate!

Examples:

* A browser add-on for sending links, images or videos to your messaging apps.
* In-browser chatting and co-browsing with friends on different messaging networks.
* Adding deep linking support to mobile browsers using the various messaging app APIs.
* A bot for accessing your browser data - history, bookmarks, or top visited sites, etc. Maybe it can send those things to your friends or other devices. Maybe it can log you into websites and get information for you.
* What else?!

## Getting Started
