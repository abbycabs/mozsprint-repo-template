1. [slide deck for stand by] + Heey, welcome to Privacy Board Game session! Here you’ll close the curtain for online SURVEILLANCE! Are you ready?!
2. [Welcome Part 2]
  * Everyone is welcome here, and we can speak in English, Spanish and Portuguese, feel free!
  * My name is _____________ and I work on/at __________________ on _________________.
3. Before we start playing (I know everyone is excited and anxiously waiting for this), let's quickly discuss those everyday situations that put our online lives at risk! Right?!
  * Get a partner!
  * Introduce yourself to your partner!
  * Discuss situations that put your online lives at risk!
  * Think on solutions to make these situations healthier with tools and good practices! (take notes)
  * Introduce you and share the situations and solutions you thought of together!
4. History
  * Thanks for the aweeesome (or not) solutions and situations here, it's exactly this matter that motivated me to create the **Privacy Board Game**, everyday situations that we don’t realize, but which put our online lives at risk. But how to teach people? How to move this forward and raise awareness of more and more people? 
  * I created an offline game during Mozilla's Global Sprint in the Offline Games Challenge, a challenge to create offline games that enact strong online safety habits through offline childhood, playground, and tabletop games.
  * I took this challenge with Cynthia and Cybelle on a beautiful afternoon in São Paulo, Brazil at Google Campus São Paulo.
  * The result? A simple game that shows everyday situations online that put our lives at risk, you will have to find out from several cards the best solution to make the situation healthy in terms of privacy, and then check if it is the best solution to solve the unhealthy situation. It's the best opportunity to learn new tips and get guidance!
  * And now our game is being mentored by Mozilla's Open Leaders, you should wait for more things and the opportunity for contributions in the coming months!
5. Let’s play NOW?!
  * Make a group
  * Take your board (in your language)
  * Read the rules
6. Let's just summarize the simple steps? Look at the first unhealthy situation - look at the risk, find the best solution on Match Cards (if you need, discuss with your team), check the solution, right? Write down your 10 XPs!
7. It's your turn, have fun and learn!
8. I hope you have enjoyed and learned a lot of tips, you can test the Back to School, a collectio of 3 games that’s based on a lot of things from our game and continue to have fun. Take a look at our GitHub to contribute and get more features!
9. Thank You, Gracias, Obrigado! I will be here all the festival, if you need anything, feel free to reach me or by Twitter at @_______.
