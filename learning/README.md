# Offline Icebreaker
Before game play in groups engage partners to discuss everyday situations that put their online lives at risk and then think about the options they have to make these situations healthier with tools and good practices. Participants then introduce themselves and share the situations and solutions they thought of together.

# Reflection
When the game play is finished you can start a quickly discussion, these questions can be a great start point:

* Was it easy to play the game?
* What is the greatest learning?
* Was something confusing?
* Something that you are interested in learning more?
* Another good tip to share?
* What behavior will you change from now on?
